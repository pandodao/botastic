# Botastic

An AI framework for building cool things.

## Motivation

- LLMs are fantastic for knowledge generation and reasoning as they're pre-trained on large amounts of publicly available data.
- In practice, we need LLMs to be able to reason about our own data.
  - Fine-tuning them is often impractical.
  - Embedding data into LLMs is a viable alternative, but requires domain expertise, and considerable effort to dealing with prompt limitations
- Botastic aims to make it easy to embed your own data into LLMs.
- Botastic also aims to make it easy to build AI-based applications to provide out-of-the-box solutions for common requirements including:
  - Conversations management
  - Intent recognition
  - Bot/Avatar management
  - more to come..., you will need them.
- Botastic aims to be easily integrated into existing systems and scalable to meet business requirements.
- We're building AI-based applications, that's why we build Botastic.
